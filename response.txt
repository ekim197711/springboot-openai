Mike pedaled through the night,
His trusty bike beneath him tight,
The moon above, a guiding light,
On his journey through the starry height.

But fate had other plans that eve,
As Mike rode on, without reprieve,
A banana peel lay in his way,
And down he fell, without delay.

The moon looked down and softly sighed,
For poor Mike and his bike untied,
But with a twinkle in her eye,
She whispered, \"Rise, you'll touch the sky.\"

So Mike got up, a bit wiser,
His journey lit by lunar visor,
He rode on, with grace and might,
Guided by the moon's soft light.

And from that night, Mike knew for sure,
The moon would guide him evermore,
Through trials and falls, he'd rise anew,
With the moon as his hero true.
